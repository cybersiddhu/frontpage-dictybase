*Computational framework for the development of the dictybase*

##### Basic installation
You should have already installed and running in your Mac computer `node`, `npm`, `grunt`, `bower`, `karma`, `yo`. If you have not, then you should VERY carefully install all of them.

### AngularJS
I used the Yeoman generator `generator-angular`, which creates the scaffold to build a web application. It also takes care of Bootstrap and Sass. Steps:

1. `sudo npm install -g generator-angular`
2. `yo angular`
